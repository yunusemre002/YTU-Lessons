# Big Data Mapreduce applications. 

In our project we will use “515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe” provided by a user who took time to scrape the data from Booking.com. 
This dataset contains 515,000 customer reviews and scoring of 1493 luxury hotels across Europe. Meanwhile, the geographical 
location of hotels are also provided for further analysis. The csv file contains 17 fields. It contains Hotel address, 
Reviews and Reviewers Scores and many other fields. We will apply 5 fonction on dataset.
